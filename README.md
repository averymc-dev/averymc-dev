### Hi there, I'm [Avery](https://www.averymclaughlin.com)  👋🏽

I'm currently a freelance web developer and I build web sites for local business and communities.
I'm looking to collaborate with others building full-stack web apps.

I also spend time VR sim racing, playing guitar, enjoying food, and casual gaming.
